## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repo. Then, `npm install`.

Create a Firebase config file:

`touch firebase_config.js`

Add your Firebase configuration into `firebase_config.js`:

```
import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore"

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE_AIzaSyAOWH',
  authDomain: 'your-auth-domain-b1234.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com',
  projectId: 'your-project-id-1234',
  storageBucket: 'your-project-id-1234.appspot.com',
  messagingSenderId: '12345-insert-yourse',
  appId: 'insert yours: 1:1234:web:ee873bd1234c0deb7eba61ce',
};

// Initialize Firebase
let firebase

getApps().length === 0 ? firebase = initializeApp(firebaseConfig) : firebase = getApp();

//get auth
const auth = getAuth(firebase)

//init firestore services
const db = getFirestore()

export { firebase, auth, db }
```

Run `expo start`.
